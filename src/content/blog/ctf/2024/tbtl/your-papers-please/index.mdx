*Moving all of my past CTF write-ups to this website...*

My flight got delayed, and I had to rebook to one that leaves 7 hours later. That leaves me free to do another write-up!

This was a simple one, but the number of solves was surprisingly few.

*Note from myself 9mo later: This actually came up in another CTF recently and had few solves.*
*It's honestly comes across as a very real bug that could happen, so I definitely recommend keeping this challenge in the back of your mind!*

Of course, there were some I couldn't solve that had a good amount of solves, so I'm not judging.

Also a quick note that I tagged it `ctf:web` because I don't recall the original category,
and, using JWTs, it might as well be web.

## Challenge
<Image src={challenge} alt="the challenge mainly featuring a link to the python code and a link to a JWT" />

Here, we're given the address to a server, the server's code,
a list of required python packages, and a [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).

Here's the server code:
```py
#!/usr/bin/python3

import base64
import datetime
import json
import os
import signal

import humanize
import jwt


# openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out private.key
# openssl ec -in private.key -pubout -out public.pem
PUBLIC_KEY = u'''-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

def myprint(s):
    print(s, flush=True)


def handler(_signum, _frame):
    myprint("Time out!")
    exit(0)


def decode(token):
    signing_input, crypto_segment = token.rsplit(".", 1)
    header_segment, payload_segment = signing_input.split(".", 1)
    header_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(header_segment)
    header = json.loads(header_data)
    alg = header["alg"]
    return jwt.decode(token, algorithms=[alg], key=PUBLIC_KEY)


def main():
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
    signal.alarm(300)

    myprint("Your papers, please.")
    token = input()
    try:
        mdl = decode(token)
        assert mdl["docType"] == "iso.org.18013.5.1.mDL"
        family_name = mdl["family_name"]
        given_name = mdl["given_name"]
        expiry_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(mdl["expiry_date"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")
    except Exception as e:
        myprint("Your papers are not in order!")
        exit(0)
    myprint("Hello {} {}!".format(given_name, family_name))
    delta = expiry_date - datetime.datetime.now()
    if delta <= datetime.timedelta(0):
        myprint("Your papers expired {} ago!".format(humanize.naturaldelta(delta)))
        exit(0)

    flag = open("flag.txt", "r").read().strip()
    myprint("Your papers are in order, here is your flag: {}".format(flag))
    exit(0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In essence, we need to give it a JWT that can be decoded with `PUBLIC_KEY` and is not expired.
Here's the JWT we're given:

```
eyJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.ATOuXnzmtdiOPhuu1ksgF6FqKjHNHJoyMLHF28xsRgVNUANFlUv9l_xM9TGg_s9ZbFy6gimaH80MSHl6wHOxg8yxAFS22jy1GEPX3Kc4ZPUKEjd7q6vbo1zLXEfNjpkwBbU6M9pbqS6CmBxM1MY93WDjNY8p5mGYdBtbD3XccmOivGDH
```

And in [decoded form](https://jwt.io/):
```jsonc
// Header:
{
  "alg": "ES512",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

// Payload
{
  "version": "1.0",

  "family_name": "TURNER",
  "given_name": "SUSAN",

  "issue_date": "2018-01-15T10:00:00.00",
  "expiry_date": "2022-08-27T12:00:00.00",
  "issuing_country": "US",
  "issuing_authority": "CO",
  "document_number": "542426814",
  "driving_privileges": [
    {
      "codes": [
        {
          "code": "D"
        }
      ],
      "vehicle_category_code": "D",
      "issue_date": "2019-01-01",
      "expiry_date": "2027-01-01"
    }
  ],
  "un_distinguishing_sign": "USA"
}

// And signature information that we don't care about.
```

## Analysis
This JWT is expired, so we can't use it directly.
Strictly speaking, we don't even have to use this JWT as a base, but let's use it anyway.

Now, until now, I wasn't familiar with the details of JWTs.
The biggest mystery is what `ES512` means, so I asked my best friend: Google Search.
It actually brought me to [a documentation page for the very library used in the server](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html)
and has a description of the various supported algorithms.
`ES512` refers to *ECDSA signature algorithm using SHA-512 hash algorithm*.
This means it uses asymmetric encryption,
which I suppose we can guess by the presence of a public key in the server anyway.

After reading this and the code, the solution jumped right out at me! In the decode function:
```py
def decode(token):
    signing_input, crypto_segment = token.rsplit(".", 1)
    header_segment, payload_segment = signing_input.split(".", 1)
    header_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(header_segment)
    header = json.loads(header_data)
    alg = header["alg"]
    return jwt.decode(token, algorithms=[alg], key=PUBLIC_KEY)
```

The algorithm is read from the header of the JWT and used to decode it.
[Double checking the API](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)...
```py
jwt.decode(jwt, key="", algorithms=None, options=None, audience=None, issuer=None, leeway=0)
```

## Exploit
It appears that, regardless of whether symmetric or asymmetric encryption is used,both use the key parameter.
The solution is therefore to encode our non-expired JWT using symmetric key encryption,
where the key is the public key that would normally be used in asymmetric encryption.
This can all be done one from [the JWT debugger page](https://jwt.io/) linked above.

```
TBTL{1n_H34d3rS_W3_Tru$7}
```

The important moral of the story, since code seems innocuous at first glance:
ignore/whitelist the the `alg` header and use only the appropriate key for the appropriate algorithm.

And, more importantly, for those designing a JWT API...

```py
jwt.decode(jwt, key="", algorithms=None, options=None, audience=None, issuer=None, leeway=0)
```

This isn't really the way to go about it. Instead, accept algorithm and key as a tuple.
It also conveniently solvesa key rotation issues if multiple keys are accepted anyway.

```py
# or, instead of or in addition to tuples, and object/dict is probably better
jwt.decode(token, keys=[("ES512", PUBLIC_KEY)])
```
