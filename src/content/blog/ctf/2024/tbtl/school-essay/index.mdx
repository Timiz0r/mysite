*Moving all of my past CTF write-ups to this website...*

This is my second-favorite challenge I completed in the CTF.
Perhaps that's because I find crypto challenges to be pretty hard.
I also suspect there were better ways to solve this, so I'm quite interested in other write-ups of this challenge.

## Challenge
<Image src={challenge} alt="challenge featuring python code and its output generated with the flag" />

First, we're given the code to generate an essay.
```py
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from redacted import FLAG

ESSAY_TEMPLATE = """
My Favorite Classmate
=====================

My favorite person in this class has a beautiful smile,
great sense of humour, and lots of colorful notebooks.

However, their most distinctive feature is the fact that
you can represent their name as an integer value, square
it modulo %d,
and you'll get %d.

Additionally, When you compute the greatest integer not exceeding
the cube root of their squared name, you get %d.

By now, all of you have probably guessed who I'm talking about.

name_int = bytes_to_long(FLAG)

assert 1 < name_int < N

value_1 = (name_int**2) % N
value_2 = invpow3(name_int**2)

print(ESSAY_TEMPLATE % (N, value_1, value_2))
```

And we're given such an essay.

## Analysis
The `value_1` expression is simple RSA with an exponent of 2, so this challenge could be a doozy.
If it was just this, we wouldn't be reasonably able to find the plaintext key from just this cyphertext (and modulus).

Luckily, we have another expression that will hopefully help us solve the challenge: `value_2 = invpow3(name_int**2)`.
This expression is reversible to a certain extent: `name_int = math.isqrt(value_2 ** 3)`

## Solution
First, let's see what we get by partially reversing the operation.

```py
from Crypto.Util.number import *
import math
long_to_bytes(math.isqrt(val2 ** 3))
# TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31mc)n\x02\xf5\xd0\xf4:\xa1+\xfdR\xe1\xec
```

So apparently this person loves a mister John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt,
which is fair, seeing as his name is my name too.
The reason we can't fully reverse the computation is because
integer math means there are multiple strings that can result in that value.

Still, we got most of the flag!
Let's clean up the string to make it easier to read.
The last character is surely `}`, since all flags have been ending in that.
There should also be an underscore before Schmidt.

```
TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31???_??????????}
```

Brute-forcing from here would take too much time, though.
Since we know roughly what the flag is supposed to look like,
we can narrow down most of the question marks to drastically bring down the search space.
```
TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31mer_schmidt???}

m=mM
e=eE3
r=rR
s=sS5
c=cC
h=hH
i=iI1
d=dD
t=tT7
```

The brute-forcing will be done against `value_1 = (name_int**2) % N` and `value_2 = invpow3(name_int**2)`.

## Code
On my machine, it takes 4min to run.
This being a CTF, there are other challenges that can be attempted in the meantime!

```py
from Crypto.Util.number import *
import itertools

def invpow3(x):
    lo, hi = 1, x
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2 + 1
        if (mid**3) <= x:
            lo = mid
        else:
            hi = mid - 1
    return lo

# we computed this earlier with:
# where q means unknown
#b'TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31mqq_qqqqqqqqqq}'

# came from the essay we were given
N = 59557942237937483757629838075432240015613811860811898821186897952866236010569299041278104165604573
val1 = 34994952631013563439857468985559745199379391295940238707110695903159545061311344766055629477728657

def char_range(c1, c2):
    for c in range(ord(c1), ord(c2)+1):
        yield chr(c)

data = [
    ["T"],

]


data = list(''.join(x) for x in data)

for flag in itertools.product(*data):
    flag = str.encode(''.join(flag))
    name = bytes_to_long(flag)
    if (name**2 % N) != val1:
        continue
    if invpow3(name**2) != val2:
        continue
    print(flag)
    break
```

## The flag
```
‚ùØ python solve.py
b'TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31mer_Schm1d7_<3}'
```

We found him!

### Fun fact
If we instead go based off only `value_2`, we get the wrong flag!
Or, rather, we're unable to figure out the last 3 characters.
```
‚ùØ python run.py
b'TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6leH31mer_schmidt!!!}'
```

If we just do `value_1`, the runtime is basically the same.

If we use `multiprocessing`, it takes longer!
This is perhaps because the setup requires takes a long time.
Didn't try threads, though.
