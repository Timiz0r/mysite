*Moving all of my past CTF write-ups to this website...*

It's been a little bit since I've done a CTF, let alone a write-up!
I've been focusing on the job search and haven't had much time.
I didn't do too well this CTF since I wanted to focus on certain difficult problems
(that I unfortunately wasn't able to solve), but the problems I did complete were fun!

## Challenge
<Image src={challenge} alt="challenge featuring a docker pull command" />

```
docker pull windex123/config-tester
```

## Analysis and solution
First, [I quickly took a look to see what tags were available](https://hub.docker.com/r/windex123/config-tester/tags).
A single `v1` tag exists. We can also take a quick look at the image layers here (or later on if we wanted):

<Image src={layers} alt="v1 tag images for visual purposes" />

There's a /tmp/config.txt. It also incidentally gets deleted in the next layer.
In any case let's see what's inside:

```
docker pull windex123/config-tester:v1
docker image save windex123/config-tester:v1 -o woo
tar xf woo

cd blobs/sha256
# will fail for some blobs, but that's okay
find . -type f -exec tar xf {} ';'
```

There's a `tmp/config.txt`, but it doesn't contain anything interesting.
Luckily, there's a `tmp/config.json`, and it appears to be a Google Cloud service account credential file.
I've removed the private key just in case, but we do indeed get the full credential.

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "uoftctf-2025-docker-chal",
  "private_key_id": "",
  "private_key": "",
  "client_email": "docker-builder@uoftctf-2025-docker-chal.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "112040922998091528251",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/docker-builder%40uoftctf-2025-docker-chal.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

After [installing the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install),
we can activate the service account and take a look at the project's IAM policies:

```sh
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=config.json
gcloud projects get-iam-policy uoftctf-2025-docker-chal
```

I've removed entries that our service account doesn't have access to, but they look something like this:

```yaml
bindings:
- members:
  - serviceAccount:docker-builder@uoftctf-2025-docker-chal.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: projects/uoftctf-2025-docker-chal/roles/iampolicyviewer
- members:
  - serviceAccount:809703936711-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:docker-builder@uoftctf-2025-docker-chal.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:gke-containerssh@containerssh-uoftctf-2025.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/artifactregistry.reader
- members:
  - serviceAccount:docker-builder@uoftctf-2025-docker-chal.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/cloudbuild.builds.viewer
etag: BwYrMml-3VU=
version: 1
```

First, we can luckily run the command we just ran thanks to iampolicyviewer,
which saves us having to try every single Google Cloud service manually.
Second, we can read through the artifact registry.
Finally, we can look through cloud builds.

I first took a look through the artifact registry. There were some docker images available...

```

...
```

But exploring them yielded nothing. Cloud builds, on the other hand, were interesting!

In particular, `c1b329e3-be72-47af-9fc3-6cdd8841d24e` had an interesting log entry:

```
