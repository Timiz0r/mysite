## Challenge
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

import challenge from 'challenge.png'
import multiselect from 'multiselect.png'

Here's what the challenge looks like:  
<Image src={challenge} alt='The screenshot of the challenge showing a UDP ip-port' />

A quick connect via `netcat` shows no output.
Typing some characters and Enter *does* return some characters, but nothing legible.

UDP... ZONE... DNS?

Yep! Unfortunately, the server has been shut down, so I can't provide sample output.

## Solution
I figured out DNS pretty quickly, so that wasn't a problem.
Still, I spent way more time on this challenge than I should have trying to find the flag.

We can use `dig` to explore the DNS server.
Some of the first records to try are `SOA`, `AFXR`, and `IFXR`.
The latter two are for "zone transfers", typically to a secondary DNS server from a primary DNS server.
They basically dump all of the zone data and are restricted to specific DNS servers.

Since the challenge's DNS server is down, here's a quick demo on my personal DNS server.

```shell
❯ dig redacted SOA

; <<>> DiG 9.20.5 <<>> redacted SOA
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

# no good output for ifxr
```

A quick note that the SOA record for the challenge's DNS server mentioned `webmaster.ZONEy.eno`,
but this never lead anywhere.

First, fun fact: in Firefox, you can hold down `Ctrl` to select cells of a table, then drag to multi-select.
Do this on [the Wikipedia page for DNS resource records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types),
and you can easily generate a list.

We can generate `dig` commands to explore what records are available.

```shell
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno A +short
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno AAAA +short
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno AFSDB +short
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno APL +short
dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno CAA +short
# ...
```

The first hit we get (aside from the dead-end SOA record) is an MX record.

```shell
❯ dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 ZONEy.eno MX +short
10 challenge.ZONEy.eno.
```

Followed by DNSSEC's NSEC and RRSIG records. Here's one:
```shell
❯ dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 challenge.zoney.eno NSEC +short
hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno. A RRSIG NSEC
```

This isn't actually the flag, incidentally. Let's go deeper.
```shell
❯ dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno NSEC +short
ns1.zoney.eno. A TXT RRSIG NSEC
```

This time, we get an additional TXT record. Let's take a look.
```shell
❯ dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 hereisthe1337flag.zoney.eno TXT +short
"ENO{1337_Fl4G_NSeC_W4LK3R}"
```

The flag!
