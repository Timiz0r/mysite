## Challenge
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

import challenge from 'challenge.png

Here's what the challenge looks like:  
<Image src={challenge} alt='The screenshot of the challenge showing an ip:port and link to the code.' />

And here's the full code:  
```python
import numpy as np
from secret import flag, quotes

prizes = quotes + ['missingno'] * 4 + [flag] * 24

if __name__ == '__main__':
	print('Welcome to our playground for powerful people where you can pump yourself up and get awesome prizes!\n')
	player_count = int(input('How many players participate?\n'))
	power = np.zeros(player_count, dtype = np.int32)
	for i in range(player_count):
		power[i] = int(input(f'Player {i}, how strong are you right now?\n'))
	ready = False

	while True:
		print('What do you want to do?\n1) pump up\n2) cash in')
		option = int(input())
		if option == 1:
			power = power**2
			ready = True
		elif option == 2:
			if not ready:
				raise Exception('Nope, too weak')
			for i in range(player_count):
				if power[i] < len(quotes):
					print(f'You got an inspiration: {prizes[power[i]]}')
			exit()
		else:
			raise Exception('What?')
```

## Analysis
There's a `prizes` variable that contains an unspecified number of quotes, 4 `'missingno'` strings,
and 24 copies of the flag.
Furthermore, we can retrieve the flag by attaining the correct power level.

The issue here is that we only get a quote if our power level is less than or equal to the number of quotes:
`if power[i] < len(quotes):`. The leaves but one option: going backwards via a negative number!
Also a quick note that we need to "power-up" at least once before we can get an "inspiration".

As far as I'm aware, Python3 numbers are infinite, so there's no way to overflow them.
Luckily, the challenge uses numpy's `int32`s: `np.zeros(player_count, dtype = np.int32)`.
The challenge is thusly to find some number that, once squared, will become a number between -24 and -1.

## Solution
A quick brute-force should do the trick:

```python
import numpy as np

for i in reversed(range(np.iinfo(np.int32).max)):
    a = np.array([i], np.int32)
    a = a ** 2
    if a[0] <= -1 and a[0] >= -24:
        print(i)
        exit(0)
```

We run the script, and few short moments later...

```
❯ python /mnt/kali/ctf/nullcon2025/powerplay/find.py
2112767193
```

A quick trip over to the challenge:

```
❯ nc 52.59.124.14 5016
Welcome to our playground for powerful people where you can pump yourself up and get awesome prizes!

How many players participate?
1
Player 0, how strong are you right now?
2112767193
What do you want to do?
1) pump up
2) cash in
1
What do you want to do?
1) pump up
2) cash in
2
You got an inspiration: ENO{d0_n0t_be_s0_neg4t1ve_wh3n_y0u_sh0uld_be_pos1t1ve}
```

And we have the flag!
