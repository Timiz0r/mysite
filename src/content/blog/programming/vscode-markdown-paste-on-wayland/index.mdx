## Markdown Paste?
First, what do I mean?
Using the [Markdown Paste](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=telesoho.vscode-markdown-paste-image)
allows for the easy pasting of, among other things, images!

{/*TODO: rendering keyboard shortcuts*/}
Pasting via `Ctrl+Alt+V` will add the corresponding markdown...
<Image src={sample} alt="sample pasted image" />

And it will of course add the file -- for which we specify the name...
<Image src={filetree} alt="file tree showing the pasted image" />

## The issue
As documented in the extension, Linux support is provided via [`xclip`](https://github.com/astrand/xclip).
I'm on Wayland, so this doesn't exactly work. Well, there's a slight chance `xclip` will *just work*,
especially since we're using the normal clipboard. Part of me regrets not having tried it...

In any case, there is
[an issue to add Wayland support](https://github.com/telesoho/vscode-markdown-paste-image/issues/116),
but there's nothing to it.

By coincidence, while reading the `wl-copy` manfile a while back,
I found out the [`wl-clipboard-x11`](https://github.com/brunelli/wl-clipboard-x11) project.
It, more or less, translates `xcopy` invocations to `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`.
The only problem is that it that
[the `-t TARGETS` option isn't supported](https://github.com/brunelli/wl-clipboard-x11/issues/1),
and [this is used by `Markdown Paste`](https://github.com/telesoho/xclip/blob/main/res/scripts/linux_clipboard_content_type.sh#L7C27-L7C43).

## The workaround
I did as one normally does and forked the repo,
adding [my own `-t TARGETS` implementation](https://github.com/Timiz0r/wl-clipboard-x11/blob/master/src/wl-clipboard-x11#L92C1-L97C21).
A quick `make install` later, and the extension works like a charm! ðŸ¥³

```sh
-t|-target)
    if [ "$2" == "TARGETS" ]; then
        CLIPBOARD_COMMAND="${WL_PASTE}"
        set -- "${@}" "--list-types"
        : $((COUNT = COUNT -1 ))
        shift 1
    else
        set -- "${@}" "--type"
    fi
    ;;
```
