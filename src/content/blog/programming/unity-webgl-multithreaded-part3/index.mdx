## Intro
Part 3 of a multi-part series!
* [Part 1](https://kyouha.today/blog/programming/unity-webgl-multithreaded): Initial C# -> JS interop implementation
* [Part 2](https://kyouha.today/blog/programming/unity-webgl-multithreaded-part2): Cross-platform implementation
* [Part 3](https://kyouha.today/blog/programming/unity-webgl-multithreaded-part3): Simplifying JS interop with Comlink

Additionally, the version of the code used is here: https://github.com/Timiz0r/WebGLMultiThreaded/tree/comlink
It contains a decent *summary* of all the code and doesn't require any prior reading.

We'll mainly be working off the code we left off with in part 2,
so considering giving it a read to follow along.
Still, I'll do my best to make this post useful without having to read prior posts.

## Goal
Using a library called [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink),
we can do away with implementing basically all of the Web Worker logic.
As a side-goal, we'll also improve the Web Worker initialization logic.

As a quick review of what our Web Workers currently look like, we need to handle incoming messages,
plus send back response messages.
```js
import { dotnet } from './_framework/dotnet.js'

onmessage = e => {
    postMessage({ requestId: e.data.requestId, command: "initializing" });
};

let assemblyExports = null;
// .net initialization

onmessage = e => {
    // ...

    try {
        if (!assemblyExports) {
            throw new Error(startupError || "worker exports not loaded");
        }

        switch (e.data.command) {
            case "Foobar":
                const num = e.data.num;
                const result = assemblyExports.OperationInterop.Foobar(num);
                return sendResponse(result)
            default:
                throw new Error("Unknown command: " + e.data.command);
        }
    }
    catch (err) {
        sendError(err)
    }
};
```

Over in Unity, we need to do all of the message receiving and passing, as well,
plus some state management to correlate messages.
```js
mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, {
  OperationRunnerInterop_Initialize: function () {
    if (window.operationRunnerInterop) return;

    window.operationRunnerInterop = new class {
      constructor() {
        const worker = new Worker('interop/wwwroot/operationRunnerInteropWorker.js', { type: "module" });
        worker.onmessage = e => {
          const command = e.data.command;
          const requestId = e.data.requestId;
        
          const callbacks = window.operationRunnerInterop.pendingRequests[requestId];
          delete window.operationRunnerInterop.pendingRequests[requestId];
          if (callbacks == null) {
            console.error("Operation response has no corresponding request.");
            return;
          }

          const success = callbacks.success;
          const failure = callbacks.failure;
          const initializing = callbacks.initializing;

          if (command === "initializing") {
            this.sendResponse(initializing, requestId, null);
            return;
          }

          if (command === "error") {
            this.sendResponse(failure, requestId, e.data.error);
            return;
          }

          if (command === "response") {
            this.sendResponse(success, requestId, e.data.result);
            return;
          }

          console.error("Unknown command: ", command);
        };

        this.worker = worker;
        this.pendingRequests = {};
        this.nextRequestId = 0;
      }

      sendRequest(request, success, failure, initializing) {
        const requestId = this.nextRequestId++;
        this.pendingRequests[requestId] = { success, failure, initializing };
        this.worker.postMessage({ ...request, requestId });
        return requestId;
      }
      
      sendResponse(callback, requestId, response) {
        const len = lengthBytesUTF8(response) + 1;
        const buffer = _malloc(len);
        stringToUTF8(response, buffer, len);
        {{{ makeDynCall('vii', 'callback') }}} (requestId, buffer);
        _free(buffer);
      }
    }();
  },

  OperationRunnerInterop_Foobar: function (num, success, failure, initializing) {
    return window.operationRunnerInterop.sendRequest({ command: "Foobar", num }, success, failure, initializing);
  },
});
```

Almost all of this logic should go away with Comlink!

## Use Comlink inside Web Workers
We'll go over how Comlink actually works in a bit, but, for now, let's start off by converting our code --
starting with `operationRunnerInteropWorker.js`, which is our call-like semantics demonstration, to use Comlink.

```js
import { dotnet } from "./_framework/dotnet.js";
import * as Comlink from "https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs";

const { getAssemblyExports, getConfig } = await dotnet.create();

const config = getConfig();
const assemblyExports = await getAssemblyExports(config.mainAssemblyName);
const interop = assemblyExports.OperationInterop;

Comlink.expose(interop);
```

For this scenario, it's as easy as `Comlink.expose`ing what we get out of .NET: `OperationInterop`.
All of our message-handling logic has gone away completely.

What about or event-like semantics demonstration: `gameLogicInteropWorker.js`?
```js
import { dotnet } from "./_framework/dotnet.js";
import * as Comlink from "https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs";

const { setModuleImports, getAssemblyExports, getConfig } = await dotnet.create();

const config = getConfig();
const assemblyExports = await getAssemblyExports(config.mainAssemblyName);
const interop = assemblyExports.GameLogicInterop;

setModuleImports("GameLogic", {
    StateChanged: data => { interop.subscriber && interop.subscriber(data); }
});

Comlink.expose(interop);
```

It's also just as easy! The only weird part is `interop.subscriber`.
We don't define this property anywhere in `GameLogicInterop`, so where does it come from? We'll see soon enough!

## Use Comlink to instantiate web workers
Within Web Workers, we use `Comlink.expose` to do all of the setup there, and we see big improvements.
What about where we instantiate them? Does `OperationRunnerInterop.jslib` improve?
```js
mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, {
  OperationRunnerInterop_Initialize: function () {
    if (window.operationRunnerInterop) return;

    window.operationRunnerInterop = new class {
      constructor() {
        import("https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs").then(Comlink => {
          this.interop = Comlink.wrap(
            new Worker('interop/wwwroot/operationRunnerInteropWorker.js', { type: "module" }));
        });
        this.nextRequestId = 0;
      }

      begin(request, success, failure) {
        const requestId = this.nextRequestId++;

        request(this.interop).then(
          result => invokeCallback(success, result),
          err => invokeCallback(failure, JSON.stringify(err)));

        return requestId;

        // NOTE: since we need to serialize WASM-side, success results should always be a string.
        // of course, errors are a bit different.
        function invokeCallback(callback, response) {
          const len = lengthBytesUTF8(response) + 1;
          const buffer = _malloc(len);
          stringToUTF8(response, buffer, len);

          {{{ makeDynCall('vii', 'callback') }}} (requestId, buffer);
          _free(buffer);
        }
      }
    }();
  },

  OperationRunnerInterop_Foobar: function (num, success, failure) {
    return window.operationRunnerInterop.begin(interop => interop.Foobar(num), success, failure);
  },
});
```

It sure has improved!
For `interop => interop.Foobar(num)`, note that `interop`, in this case, is a `Worker` wrapped in a `Comlink.wrap`.
Instead of having to implement message handling within the Web Worker and the place we instantiate it,
`Comlink` translates calls (aka `apply`; also does `get`s, `set`s, and more) into messages,
messages back into calls, return values to messages, and messages back into return values.

The request id correlation has also improved. We no longer need to store a map as a part of the helper class.
Instead, `interop.Foobar(num)` returns a `Promise`,
and the callbacks we use with `Promise`s need only capture the request id.

For `GameLogicInterop.jslib`, it's imporant to note that the code below will not work.
```js
mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, {
  WebGLGameLogic_Initialize: function (eventHandler) {
    if (window.WebGLGameLogic) return;

    window.WebGLGameLogic = new class {
      constructor () {
        import("https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs").then(Comlink => {
          this.interop = Comlink.wrap(
            new Worker('interop/wwwroot/gameLogicInteropWorker.js', { type: "module" }));
          // `this` isn't what we think `this` is thanks to the Comlink proxy,
          // so we wrap the handleEvent call in an arrow func to capture the right `this`
          this.interop.subscriber = Comlink.proxy(data => this.handleEvent(data));
        });

        this.eventHandler = eventHandler;
      }

      update(time) {
        this.interop.Update(time);
      }

      // NOTE: since we need to serialize WASM-side, data will be a string, so no need to JSON.stringify
      handleEvent(data) {
        const len = lengthBytesUTF8(data) + 1;
        const buffer = _malloc(len);
        stringToUTF8(data, buffer, len);

        const eventHandler = this.eventHandler;
        {{{ makeDynCall('vi', 'eventHandler') }}} (buffer);
        _free(buffer);
      }
    }();
  },

  WebGLGameLogic_Update: function (time) {
    window.WebGLGameLogic.update(time);
  },
});
```

Remember this code in our Web Worker script?
```js
setModuleImports("GameLogic", {
    StateChanged: data => { interop.subscriber && interop.subscriber(data); }
});
```

Here we can see where `interop.subscriber` came from:
Comlink will translate the `set` into the appropriate operation in the Web Worker script.

The reason this code will not work is that our Web Worker script is asynchronous.
We only call `Comlink.expose(interop);` after `await`ing all of the .NET initialization:
```js
// ...
const { setModuleImports, getAssemblyExports, getConfig } = await dotnet.create();
// ...
const assemblyExports = await getAssemblyExports(config.mainAssemblyName);
// ...
Comlink.expose(interop);
```

Setting `this.interop.subscriber` will result in a message being sent to the Web Worker,
and we do this immediately after instantiating `Worker` (and wrapping it).
However, the `message` handler within the Web Worker script won't be ready to receive the message, and it gets dropped.

## Improving initialization logic
We need some way to signal that the Web Worker is ready before we set `this.interop.subscriber`.
While not strictly necessary for our `operationRunnerInteropWorker.js`, we'll do it anyway.

First, let's send a message after our call to `Comlink.expose`, for both scripts.
```js
// ...
Comlink.expose(interop);
postMessage("_init");
```

Our `OperationRunnerInterop.jslib` changes will be pretty simple.
```js
      constructor() {
        const worker = new Worker('interop/wwwroot/operationRunnerInteropWorker.js', { type: "module" });
        worker.onmessage = m => {
          if (m.data === "_init") {
            import("https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs").then(Comlink => {
              this.interop = Comlink.wrap(worker);
              this.initComplete = true;
            });
          }
        }

        this.nextRequestId = 0;
      }

      begin(request, success, failure) {
        if (!this.initComplete) return -1;
        // ...
      }
```

After instantiating our `Worker`, we immediately add a `message` handler that looks for our special `_init` message.
If we find it, we perform the rest of our initialization -- in this case, setting `this.initComplete`.
The reason we do the `Comlink.wrap` here is because `Comlink.wrap` will overwrite our special `message` event handler.

Our `GameLogicInterop.jslib` will be pretty similar.
```js
      constructor () {
        const worker = new Worker('interop/wwwroot/gameLogicInteropWorker.js', { type: "module" });
        worker.onmessage = m => {
          if (m.data === "_init") {
            import("https://unpkg.com/comlink/dist/esm/comlink.mjs").then(Comlink => {
              this.interop = Comlink.wrap(worker);
              // `this` isn't what we think `this` is thanks to the Comlink proxy,
              // so we wrap the handleEvent call in an arrow func to capture the right `this`
              this.interop.subscriber = Comlink.proxy(data => this.handleEvent(data));
              this.initComplete = true;
            });
          }
        };

        this.eventHandler = eventHandler;
      }

      update(time) {
        if (!this.initComplete) return;
        this.interop.Update(time);
      }
```

Now we only set `subscriber` after our Web Worker is ready to receive the message and Comlink is ready to handle it.

## Conclusion
And that's it! No more message handling!
This was perhaps the most tedious part of the prior solutions, and we no longer need to handle it.
The tedium of adding new events and new calls still exists, though.

As implemented in the event-like demonstration, additional events would require changes to:
* WASM
* Web Worker
* jslib
* C# code that interfaces with jslib

As implemented in the call-like demonstration, adding new operations requires changes to:
* WASM
* jslib
* C# code that interfaces with jslib

In both cases, the changes aren't complicated, but they are prone to copy-paste errors.
I have two more followup posts planned that will tackle this:
1. Using Roslyn to take our initial `GameLogic` and `Foobar` classes
   and generate WASM, Web Worker, jslib, and `C# code that interfaces with jslib` code.
2. Taking everything we've learned and summarizing all prior parts into a single, easy to read post.
   We'll start with an empty Unity project and make all the optimal decisions!
