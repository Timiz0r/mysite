			these are hard to lay out well. they tend to be too large and take up a whole row,
			which throws everything off.

			the easiest solution is to set a width! this works okay for most cases,
			except when they flex grow -- where the table doesn't grow with it. this is due to prose's max width.

			the solution is to set max width to full or whatever. if we were to remove the hard-coded width,
			the table would then actually take up the full width no matter what. this doesnt matter here,
			but it matters if we wanted to remove it.
